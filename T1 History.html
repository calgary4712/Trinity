Daniel's vision there is no reference to political or military

vision of Daniel, the Son of Man's authority comes not from the
number of followers or the size of his army but from the Ancient of

Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, &ldquo;Son, your
sins are forgiven.&rdquo; Now some teachers of the law were sitting
there, thinking to themselves, &ldquo;Why does this fellow talk like

Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were
thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, &ldquo;Why are you
thinking these things? Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man,
&lsquo;Your sins are forgiven,&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Get up, take

that time, Constantine was emperor of the western Roman empire and in

battles of its own as well: there was an intense debate going on

is out to protect the Oneness of God which was the faith of Israel
and so obviously there can only be One who is ingenerate. It is only
normal to think that One also means one person - it is what human
experience teaches us. For each human person there is only one human
nature and also for each instance of human nature there is only one
person. So if we take seriously that the Son is a different person
than the Father, as Arius did, (some didn't) then it follows that the
Father has a nature and the Son has a nature and since there can only
be one ingenerate divine nature this belongs to the Father alone
leaving the Son with a divinity that is not eternal - sort of a
divine creature.</FONT></FONT></P>

necessarily one light; it cannot be said that those lights are two
lights. The sun and its radiance are indeed two different things, yet
there is only one light that comes from the sun and with its radiance
illumines the entire world. Thus in a similar way the divinity of the
Son is also that of the Father, and for this reason it is also
singular, and therefore God is one and there is no other besides him.
Hence, because they are one and their divinity is one, it follows
that the same things are said of the Son as are said of the Father,
with the exception of the name 'Father'... For as the Son himself
says, 'All that the Father has are mine' </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 15pt">Athanasius
ends up giving a rule that can be used in regarding the relationship
between the Father and the Son: &ldquo;the same things are said of
the Son as are said of the Father, with the exception of the name
Father&rdquo;. So just as the Father is Eternal, Almighty, Immutable
so is the Son, but anything that has to do with Fatherhood (i.e.
beggeting) cannot be applied to the Son. In this way the Father and
Son are distinct persons with the same, identical nature.</FONT></FONT></P>

would think that the issue would be settled after the Council but
instead it became even more intense. Christianity was by now the
official religion of the empire and so the Roman emperors felt they
had a say in church matters. Several of the emperors following the
years after the council were of Arian persuasion and as a result
bishops faithful to the Nicene Creed were exiled (Anthanasius was
exiled five times from Alexandria). At one point, even the Pope in
Rome was exiled and an Arian anti-Pope was set up. In 379 A.D.
Theodosius I became emperor who was of the Nicene Creed persuasion.
It was under his rule that the next ecumenical council was called.</FONT></FONT></P>

Council of Constantinople reinforces what was stated in the Nicene
Creed and goes on to further elaborate about the Holy Spirit. When it
came to the Holy Spirit all the Creed of 325 stated was 'and the Holy
Spirit'. More needed to be said, but what? We have had a taste of how
difficult it was to accept that the Son was God even with statements
in the Gospel of John (Word was God) and Paul's letter to the
Philippians (equality with God). How much more difficult to accept
the divinity of the Holy Spirit who is never called God in the New
Testament writing. Some considered the Holy Spirit to be a creature
taking John 1:3 (through him all things were made) to include the
Holy Spirit as one of those made. Others would not accept that the
Holy Spirit was a creature but neither did they say the Holy Spirit
was divine.</FONT></FONT></P>

of those who considered the Holy Spirit to be God was Basil, Bishop
of Caesarea (330-379). As an indication of how heated the debate was
at this time, Basil never openly states that the Holy Spirit is God
but infers it from his arguments. We include some of them below taken
from his work 'De Spiritu Sancto' (Of the Holy Spirit).</FONT></FONT></P>

Peter's words to Sapphira, &ldquo;How is it that you have agreed
together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? You have not lied unto men,
but unto God&rdquo;, show that sins against the Holy Spirit and

the Father and the Son.</FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Be it so, it is rejoined, but glory</SPAN> <SPAN LANG="en-US">is by
no means so absolutely due to the Spirit as to require His exaltation
by us in doxologies...It is, at all events, possible for us to arrive
to a certain extent at intelligent apprehension of the sublimity of
His nature and of His unapproachable power, by looking at the meaning
of His title, and at the magnitude of His operations, and by His good
gifts bestowed on us or rather on all creation. He is called Spirit,
as God is a Spirit... He is called holy as the Father is holy , and
the Son is holy, for to the creature holiness</SPAN> <SPAN LANG="en-US">was
brought in from without, but to the Spirit holiness is the
fulfillment</SPAN> <SPAN LANG="en-US">of nature, and it is for this
reason that He is described not as being sanctified, but as
sanctifying. He is called good, as the Father is good, and He who was
begotten of the Good is good, and to the Spirit His goodness is
essence. He is called upright, as the Lord is upright, in that He is
Himself truth, and is Himself Righteousness, having no divergence nor
leaning to one side or to the other, on account of the immutability
of His substance...Thus names are borne by the Spirit in common with
the Father and the Son, and He gets these titles from His natural and
close relationship. From what other source could they be derived? </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

is using the rule of Athanasius (see above) and applying it to the
Holy Spirit: what is said of the Father and Son can be said of the

arguments as these Basil was able to convince others of the divinity
of the Holy Spirit and so when the Council of Constantinople was
called the statement regarding the Holy Spirit was expanded.</FONT></FONT></P>

as a reflection of the times, the Holy Spirit is not explicitly
called God but since the Holy Spirit is worshiped and glorified with
the Father and Son it can be safely inferred that the Holy Spirit is
God along with the Father and Son. And so after the Council of
Constantinople, it is official Church teaching that the Father is
God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God, all equally God, but
there is only one God.</FONT></FONT></P>
